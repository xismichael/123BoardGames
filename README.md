Completed all functions as stated in TicTacToe.cpp, navigated through all the files to find out the parent class and what they doâ€¨

Added a function that removes AI player in Game.cpp and Game.h

Added two check box that represents p1 and p2 for using AI, and when the checkbox is checked, ai will be playing for that player. For now the AI will be simply placing at the first available square. I will update this once I have time

Moved game over variable from Class ClassGame to Class TicTacToe, to better manage what can be accessed after the game is over (to prevent more plays on the board)
